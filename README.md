# Space shooter

## Dependencies:
* Pygame - ***pip install pygame*** does everything to get this installed.

## Usage:
Simply execute the command: ***python main.py*** to launch your game. 

Note: My Linux Display Drivers have some issues so the GUI may not as pleasing it is actually is. Try it out yourself :smile:
